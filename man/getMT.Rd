\title{grab the mitochondrial reads from a BAM and estimate their fraction}
\usage{
getMT(bam, chrM = "chrM", mtGenome = "hg19", plotMAPQ = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bam}{a BAM filename, which should have an index (else index it)}

\item{chrM}{what the mitochondrial contig is called. Default is "chrM"}

\item{mtGenome}{what mitochondrial assembly was used (default is hg19)}

\item{plotMAPQ}{plot distribution of mitochondrial mapping quality? (FALSE)}
}
\description{
nb. this could probably be done faster for a list of BAMs but it's not
nb. nb. returns NuMt-depleted mitochondrial GenomicAlignments
FIXME: liftOver hg18/hg19-aligned results to rCRS for better variant calls
