# ATACseeker: A toolkit for ATAC- and scATAC-seq analysis

ATACseeker can work on both bulk ATAC-seq and scATAC-seq data. Prior to analysis with ATACseeker the data from GSE74912 were pre-processed using BWA mem and samblaster (to mark duplicates). The data were aligned to hg19. Once BAMs have been generated, they are good to go for analysis with ATACseeker.
